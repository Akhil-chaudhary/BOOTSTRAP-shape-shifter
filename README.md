# Actions
The column’s height and colors, and the container’s height and width, are already included in style.css. Your goal is to recreate the painting by:

using the existing container.
unscrambling the order of the provided columns.
adjusting the widths of the provided columns.
adding new rows and additional columns.
nesting row(s) inside columns.
Here, as we click on a container it starts changing it's shape and size.
